<h2> Biography</h2>
<p2>I was born in Brooklyn, New York on March 19th 2005. Ever since I was a young kid, 
    I had an interest in hardware and technologies that came from videogames and tinkering 
    with old CRT tv's. Despite being born in Brooklyn, I lived in Staten Island my 
    entire life 
    and live in the North Shore. I attended PS21 for elementary school,
     IS72 for middle school  and now currently I'm a rising senior 
     for Susan E. Wagner High School.
     Current interests include music (specifically Jazz and Hip-hop), 
     Computer Science, Programming, Chemistry and Running.
     I have a pet bird named Joshua and he's annoying</p2>
